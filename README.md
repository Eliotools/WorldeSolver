# LEMOT

This project is a wordle solver for wordle.louan.me

## WhoToDo

in file.txt, write :

    in the first line => letters that are not in the word

    in the second line => letters that are in the word ( wrong or right placed )

    in the third line => letters that are in the word ( if you don't know a lettre put a '*')

    in the first line => letters that are in the word but wrong placed (eatch place is delimited by a ',')


##  Exemple

ORM         => there is no 'o', 'r' or 'm' in the word

ESLIP       => there is at least a 'e', 's', 'l', 'i' and 'p' in the word

***ES       => the 'e' and the 's' are at the end of the word

L,I,,,      => the 'l' should not be in first position and the 'i' in third


Enjoy !
